Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a graduate from the University of Toronto, with a triple major in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. I work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon (AWS Serverless Messaging). 

Feel free to browse my projects and reach out if you are interested in reviving any incomplete ones. 

I've previously worked at [CERN](https://home.cern/) and [Bare Cove Technology](https://barecovetech.com/#/). 

You can reach me at jalukaharsh_at_gmail_dot_com.
